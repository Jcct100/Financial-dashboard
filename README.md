# Financial-dashboard

This financial dashboard allows you to check the monthly income and payment method from your client. It does this by filtering the date from the date selector. Also it allows you to download a report in CSV format. 

# Approach
I was looking up chart.js and Elastic search/ Kibana. In the end I decide to use Chart.js because Elastic search is more suited to use when there is a large set of data. I was working on my own to build in this project.

If I were to build this again, I would use declarative JS syntax only like map and filter instead of loop as it keeps my code cleaner and more readable. In this project I learn to build with the user in mind such as making sure most element of the dashboard is content management.
